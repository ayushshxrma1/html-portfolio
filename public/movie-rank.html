<h2>You can find that below :</h2>
<hr />
<br />
<h3>1.  Fast & Furious</h3>

It's one of favourite movie. I love cars and this movie all about Cars.<br />
I personally love that lykan super hypersport car in the film and toyota supra specially.<br />
All the amazing characters i also love in the film like Brian O'Conner, Vin Diesel, Mia and others. <br />

<h3>2. Ra. One</h3>

This movie released in 2011 and it's india's first superhero film featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a hero. <br/>
I still remember watching this movie at late when it first broadcasted on television. It started at 9 PM. and i was having dabba tv in my house of LG or Onida i guess. <br />
At the time when the hour needle pointed at 9, I took the remote and opened channel Sony Max.<br />
After then, I thought to watch the whole movie but unfortunately couldn't because the lights were all shut off in the room and I was falling asleep too. <br />

<h3>3. Chennai Express </h3>

So, it's again shah rukh khan movie. It's an  amazing love story movie. <br />
It's basically about a halwaiwala who's travelling thru train and in the journey itself he falls in love with a girl. <br />
That girl is Deepika Padukone and she's from south Indian whose father is a don of their locality. And the boy is from North India. <br />
it released in 2014 i guess and the songs in the movie were also amazing. All are melody love songs. <br />

<h3>4. The Pale Blue Eye</h3>

It's Netflix original movie based on a Novel. I recently watched this few months back. <br />
I basically love all netflix movie because of their video effects. Their videos are edited in such a way that it looks so unreal and fantasy types. <br />
This movie is all about a school in which all students are surprisingly dissappearing continuosly. <br />
And the school principal allots a mystery solver man and then he finds out all the mystery.
